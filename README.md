# **Important**
Dearpygui **AND** netmiko needs to be installed for it to run

# Why it exists
This is for my school project where i have created a file to get the running config from any cisco device using the cisco ios.
This can be changed in the init function of the config class, though i cannot promise that it will work without errors.
